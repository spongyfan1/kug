    <p> Y'all remember Kaden's Unblocked Games? Yeah, it's back. If you're a teacher/principal/IT guy from my school, please check out the About page before y'all give me ISS again.</p>
    <p> This IS a work in progress. Only a few games here right now just to get it up and running. More games coming soon, I promise. Head over to <a class=link href="games.html"> Games </a> to start playing.</p>
